CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:15 (add_subdirectory):
  The source directory

    /home/uav_master/vision_ws/src/rovio/lightweight_filtering

  does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.

  CMake does not support this case but it used to work accidentally and is
  being allowed for compatibility.

  Policy CMP0014 is not set: Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.  Run
  "cmake --help-policy CMP0014" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  Project 'lightweight_filtering' specifies

  include dir, which is not found.  It does neither exist as an absolute
  directory nor in

  Ask the maintainer 'Michael Bloesch <bloeschm@@ethz.ch>' to fix it.
